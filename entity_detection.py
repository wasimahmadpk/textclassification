At least 285 people have contracted measles in the city since September, mostly in Brooklynâ€™s Williamsburg neighborhood. The order covers four Zip codes there, Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said Tuesday.

The mandate orders all unvaccinated people in the area, including a concentration of Orthodox Jews, to receive inoculations, including for children as young as 6 months old. Anyone who resists could be fined up to $1,000.""")
